<div class='title'>Information</div>
<div class='content'>TVHClient contains a variety of features that are free to use and will remain free. The ongoing development and adding new features (partially requested by users) is time consuming. So I have decided to add a in-app purchase option. For a small fee you can enable additional features. It will also ensure the further development and shows your support. Thank you!
